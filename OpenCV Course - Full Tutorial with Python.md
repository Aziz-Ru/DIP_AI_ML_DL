# OpenCV Course - Full Tutorial with Python

This video covers the following topics:

- Introduction
- Basic methods (Gaussian blur, Canny edge detection, Dilate, Erode, cv.resize)
- Image transformations (Translate function, Rotate function)
- Contours (using Canny edge detection, blur + Canny edge, threshold)
- Changing color spaces (BGR to HSV, BGR to GRAY, BGR to LAB, BGR to RGB and vice versa)
- Extracting colors (blue, green, red)
- Blurring (Average blur, Gaussian, Median, Bilateral)
- Bitwise operations (Bitwise and, Bitwise or, Bitwise xor)
